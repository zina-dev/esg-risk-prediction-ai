# ESG Risk Prediction using AI & Machine Reasoning

## Overview
This project develops an AI-driven ESG risk prediction pipeline that combines
structured ESG financial indicators with machine learning and reasoning-based
components to support transparent and explainable ESG risk assessment.

The goal is to move beyond black-box ESG scores and provide
data-driven, interpretable risk insights for decision-makers.

## Problem Motivation
Traditional ESG ratings often lack transparency, consistency, and adaptability.
This project addresses these limitations by:
- leveraging structured ESG KPIs
- integrating rule-based and causal reasoning
- emphasizing explainability alongside prediction performance

## Methodology
The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
   - ESG financial indicators
   - Domain-informed feature construction

2. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Supervised learning models for ESG risk prediction
   - Modular design to support model comparison

3. **Machine Reasoning Layer**
   - Rule-based logic for ESG risk interpretation
   - Causal reasoning support for dependency analysis

## Dataset
Due to size and licensing constraints, datasets are not included.
The project is designed to work with publicly available ESG datasets
(e.g., ESG financial indicators from public providers).

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Machine learning for structured data
- Explainable AI & reasoning-aware modeling
- Research-oriented project structuring
